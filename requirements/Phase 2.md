## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- There should be way to persist the team members between sessions in localstorage.

- Show a timer to select between 60, 120 and 150 seconds that will be applied to each person. I dont want a seperate time selection for each person.
  - when the time is about to run out in 20 seconds, the timer should turn red and the text should be bold.
  - when the time is over ring a soft bell sound.
  - when all the turns are over, show a nice little animation and a message that standup is complete.

- if a team member is not present, the timer should be paused and the person should be skipped.

- if a member name exists then there should be a message that the same name is already present.

- show a micro-animation when drawing next person; tiny confetti/sparkle once per standup completion.

- Chips: add subtle color badges/avatars (initials). Show remove “×” on hover/focus to reduce noise.

- Replace “Who’s up next?” with “Up now” and show the name immediately after Start. Below it: small “Next: Alice • Bob • …” queue.

Change “Ready to start” → “Not started”, then “In progress”, then “All done”.

Clarify buttons: Primary = Start/Next/Finish, Secondary = Reset, Tertiary = Options.
